## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey, I’m **Dominik Bobruška** — a frontend developer who enjoys building  
**dark, minimal, and clean UIs** with React ⚛️.

I like:
- smooth UX & subtle animations 🎬  
- aesthetic color palettes (especially purple) 💜  
- simple, modular architecture 🧩  
- fast builds & clean code ⚡  

Right now I'm focused on sharpening my React skills and building projects that feel *nice* to use.
